# ORCA-EvOp
A framework for evolutionary collision-avoidance optimization for drones trajectories based on ORCA.


## Introduction
ORCA-EvOp is a general framework developed for the optimization of Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance algorithm through the use of Evolutionary Strategies. The project was developed for the Third International Workshop On Advances In Innovative Drone Enhanced Application.
