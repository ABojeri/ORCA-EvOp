# ORCA-EvOp
A framework for evolutionary collision-avoidance optimization for drones trajectories based on ORCA.


## Introduction
ORCA-EvOp is a general framework developed for the optimization of Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance algorithm through the use of Evolutionary Strategies. The project was developed for the [Third International Workshop On Advances In Innovative Drone Enhanced Application](https://www.fruct.org/idea20).
